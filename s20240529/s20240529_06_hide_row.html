                The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>
                Not a footprint to be seen<br>
                A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I‚Äôm the queen<br>
                The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>
                Couldn‚Äôt keep it in, heaven knows I tried<br>
                <br>
                Don‚Äôt let them in, don‚Äôt let them see<br>
                Be the good girl you always have to be<br>
                Conceal, don‚Äôt feel, don‚Äôt let them know<br>
                Well now they know<br>
                <br>
                Let it go, let it go<br>
                Can‚Äôt hold it back anymore<br>
                Let it go, let it go<br>
                Turn away and slam the door<br>
                I don‚Äôt care what they‚Äôre going to say<br>
                Let the storm rage on<br>
                The cold never bothered me anyway.<br>
                <br>
                It‚Äôs funny how some distance<br>
                Makes everything seems small<br>
                And the fears that once controlled me<br>
                Can‚Äôt get to me at all<br>
                <br>
                It‚Äôs time to see what I can do<br>
                To test the limits and break through<br>
                No right, no wrong, no rules for me,<br>
                I‚Äôm free<br>
                <br>
                Let it go, let it go<br>
                I am one with the wind and sky<br>
                Let it go, let it go,<br>
                You‚Äôll never see me cry<br>
                Here I stand and Here I‚Äôll stay<br>
                Let the storm rage on‚Ä¶<br>
                <br>
                My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>
                My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>
                And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br>
                I‚Äôm never going back<br>
                The past is in the past<br>
                <br>
                Let it go, let it go<br>
                And I‚Äôll rise like the break of dawn<br>
                Let it go, let it go<br>
                That perfect girl is gone<br>
                Here I stand in the light of day<br>
                Let the storm rage on<br>
                The cold never bothered me anyway<br>

                It's never too late to turn things around<br>
                Recover, unravel the path to confound<br>
                The doubters and losers that line up despair<br>
                Will tell you it's over, you're going nowhere<br>
                It's never too late, I hope<br>
                It's never too late<br>
                <br>
                It's never too late to get back on track<br>
                To get at least some, if not all of it back<br>
                I thought I was happy, and sometimes I was<br>
                The sadness is just as important because<br>
                Got to carry the weight and hope<br>
                It's never too late<br>

                Never too late to win the day<br>
                Never too late to break away<br>
                Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends<br>
                I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end<br>
                Oh no, it's never too late<br>
                <br>
                It's never too late to get up off the ground<br>
                Don't have to be noticed, don't have to crowned<br>
                I get what I done and I don't try to hide<br>
                I lost many things, but never my pride<br>
                It's never too late, I know<br>
                It's never too late<br>
                <br>

                <br>
                I used to say I don't have time, I'm sleepin' tonight<br>
                A day doin' nothin' is doin' it right<br>
                No hurry, no hurry, take as long as it takes<br>
                You might as well sleep for all the difference it makes<br>
                I didn't find love or the peace or the breaks<br>
                These aren't excuses, but a string of mistakes<br>
                I won't go back there, not goin' back there<br>

                <br>
                You think you own whatever land you land on<br>
                The earth is just a dead thing you can claim<br>
                But I know every rock and tree and creature<br>
                Has a life, has a spirit, has a name<br>
                You think the only people who are people<br>
                Are the people who look and think like you<br>
                But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger<br>
                You'll learn things you never knew you never knew<br>
                <br>
                Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon<br>
                Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?<br>
                Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?<br>
                Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?<br>
                Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?<br>
                <br>
                Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest<br>
                Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth<br>
                Come roll in all the riches all around you<br>
                And for once, never wonder what they're worth<br>
                The rainstorm and the river are my brothers<br>
                The heron and the otter are my friends<br>
                And we are all connected to each other<br>
                In a circle, in a hoop that never ends<br>
                <br>
                Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon<br>
                Or let the eagle tell you where he's been<br>
                Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?<br>
                Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?<br>
                Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?<br>
                <br>
                How high does the sycamore grow?<br>
                If you cut it down, then you'll never know<br>
                <br>
                And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon<br>
                For whether we are white or copper skinned<br>
                We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain<br>
                We need to paint with all the colors of the wind<br>
                You can own the earth and still<br>
                All you'll own is earth until<br>
                <br>
                You can paint with all the colors of the wind<br>
